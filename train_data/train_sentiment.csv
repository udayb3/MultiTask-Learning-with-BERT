30	"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time."	4
31	"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!"	3
32	"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..

36	Service experience was very good especially by Papiya. Food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well. I would like to visit Beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price.	5
37	Service , Food and Ambiance was very nice. Staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food. Live music was like cherry on the cake	5
38	The food was ‚ù§Ô∏è.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.	5
39	Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.	5
40	I came here with my parents. We ordered for Thai peneer tikka, kaju pulao and veg biryani. The kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good. This is a decent place to go with family. Shubro and papiya served well.	4
41	Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience	5
42	Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service.	5
43	"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
Shoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon."	4
44	"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!"	4
45	Had lunch today at beyond flavors .The food was very Good and delicious and awesome service was provided by Soumen Das & Shuvro. Would highly recommend the restaurant .	5
46	The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.	3
47	Service is really exceptional. Cheers to Manav, who served us really well. Food was nice too. Loved the ambience too, with nice music playing in the background.	4
48	"Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!

49	Papiya Shuvro was great. She helped us get the tables quickly and suggested us the best sizzlers in the menu. Ambience was awesome.

57	"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay."	3
58	The place is just beyond beautiful. Ambience is excellent and food is good. The service by Soumen Das is extremely good. Highly recommended place.	4
59	"I have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.
I would specially recommend their soups, the healthy broth soup and the roasted chicken soup are amazing.
In addition the service is great and our server Papiya was very courteous and prompt. This place has become my go to place for a good dining experience."	5
60	If you have time to waste for taste u r most welcome ... the taste was really superb but the service was very very slow..! Dishes were impressively having different flavours which i liked..!	4

Ambience is really great, especially PDR(Private Dining Room) is awesome...üòçüëåüèª"	5
67	we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,	1
68	"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food."	5
69	"Second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. Very courteous staff and very hospitile.
Taste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .
Very impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up."	5
70	We ordered Vegetable Lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka, both of which were absolutely delicious. The ambience is amazing and the service is good.	5
