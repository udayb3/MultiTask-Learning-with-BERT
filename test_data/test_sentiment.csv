71	One of the best food experiences I had in hyderabad. The desserts was yum. Appricot pudding is must have. @Ahmed Khan your service was unparalled. Keep up the good work.	5
72	"Ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... He may suggest great food as he has good experience. The staters and sizzler was too good. The sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. Nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
Great experience in beyond flavors."	5
73	Had dinner at this place and the attendant was Papiya. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome. Good variety of food and beverages.	5
74	"We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good .We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.The buffet spread was one of a kind:
Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!
Overall :3.2"	3
75	"Good Ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
I‚Äôve got best company here by ANANYA (Beyond Flavours)
The place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
Great place for friends."	4
76	"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!"	2
77	"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu."	3
78	"It's one of the best places to hangout with friends. Seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc.
Food was very good and the ambience was also very nice.
Loved everything.‚ù§"	5

80	"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."	1
81	"Hostile staff, okeish food, not so great ambiance. Not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 4.1
Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place."	1
82	Thanks Ahmed Food is great will recommend to visit again and again. Service is excellent and ambience is good , we had a great time with my family	5
83	This is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good ,beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of money.i am personally highly recommend this place.great flavour of food and very much prompt service.ambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant.	5
84	Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.	2
85	This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.	1
86	This is the place I really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food lover.pasta and sizzlers are so yummy that I cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than other.service is the part were you really satisfied.	5

93	It‚Äôs a worst service experience. Food was OK. They took 45mins to get veg pulav. Never seen a restaurant to take such time. Won‚Äôt visit again.	1
94	Waiters are not good enough and you will get items which you have not ordered. Overall a bad experience. Waiting time is more than expected...	1
95	Awesome food, very good ambience, centrally located, ample parking....coordination between serving boys / service has scope for improvement, boys very courteous though. Not sure why the bar was closed on a Saturday evening....Overall good experience & extremely value for money....will visit again!	4
96	Was there for office lunch outing. Rating would be mixed because food was fine but service was very bad. Booked table a day before but still had to wait for 30-40 mins to get one. Manager was polite but gave some rubbish reasons for bad service. Ambiance is fine.	3
